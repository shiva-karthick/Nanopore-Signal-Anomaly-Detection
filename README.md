## The Project: A Signal Processing Approach to Pre-processing Raw Nanopore Data.
The "Big Question" You Are Answering: Can classical signal processing techniques, like those used in electrical engineering, improve the quality of raw Nanopore data before it's fed into a complex AI model like Rockfish?

## Project Overview
This project aims to explore the application of classical signal processing techniques to enhance the quality of raw Nan
opore data. The goal is to determine whether these techniques can effectively pre-process the data before it is analyzed by complex AI models, such as Rockfish.

The project will involve the development of a pre-processing pipeline that applies various signal processing methods to raw Nanopore data, followed by an evaluation of the impact on AI model performance.
## Objectives
1. To apply classical signal processing techniques to raw Nanopore data.
2. To develop a pre-processing pipeline that prepares the data for AI models.
3. To evaluate the performance of AI models like Rockfish on pre-processed data.
4. To document the methods and results of the project comprehensively.


## Key Components
1. **Signal Processing Techniques**: Implement classical signal processing methods to filter and enhance raw Nan
opore data.
1. **Data Pre-processing**: Develop a robust pre-processing pipeline that prepares the data for
complex AI models.
1. **AI Model Integration**: Integrate the pre-processed data with AI models like
Rockfish to evaluate the impact of signal processing on model performance.
1. **Evaluation Metrics**: Define metrics to assess the quality of the pre-processed data
and the performance of the AI models.
1. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of the methods, results, and findings throughout the
project.

## Expected Outcomes
